<h2>History of big data</h2>

The 20th Century:<br>
The first major data project is created in 1937 and was ordered by the Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration in the USA. After the Social Security Act became
law in 1937, the government had to keep track of contribution from 26 million Americans and more than 3 million employers. IBM got the contract to develop 
punch card-reading machine for this massive bookkeeping project.
The first data-processing machine appeared in 1943 and was developed by the British to decipher Nazi codes during World War II. This device, named Colossus,
searched for patterns in intercepted messages at a rate of 5.000 characters per second. Thereby reducing the task from weeks to merely hours.
In 1952 the National Security Agency (NSA) is created and within 10 years contract more than 12.000 cryptologists. They are confronted with information overload 
during the Cold War as they start collecting and processing intelligence signals automatically.
In 1965 the United Stated Government decided to build the first data centre to store over 742 million tax returns and 175 million sets of fingerprints by
transferring al those records onto magnetic computer tape that had to be stored in a single location. The project was later dropped out of fear for ‘Big Brother’,
 but it is generally accepted that it was the beginning of the electronic data storage era.
In 1989 British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented eventually the World Wide Web. He wanted to facilitate the sharing of information via a ‘hypertext’
system. Little could he know at the moment the impact of his invention.
As of the ‘90s the creation of data is spurred as more and more devices are connected to the internet. In 1995 the first super-computer is built, which was able
to do as much work in a second than a calculator operated by a single person can do in 30.000 years.<br>

The 21st Century:<br>
In 2005 Roger Mougalas from O’Reilly Media coined the term Big Data for the first time, only a year after they created the term Web 2.0. It refers to a large 
set of data that is almost impossible to manage and process using traditional business intelligence tools.
2005 is also the year that Hadoop was created by Yahoo! built on top of Google’s MapReduce. It’s goal was to index the entire World Wide Web and nowadays the
open-source Hadoop is used by a lot organizations to crunch through huge amounts of data.
As more and more social networks start appearing and the Web 2.0 takes flight, more and more data is created on a daily basis. Innovative startups slowly
start to dig into this massive amount of data and also governments start working on Big Data projects. In 2009 the Indian government decides to take an
iris scan, fingerprint and photograph of all of tis 1.2 billion inhabitants. All this data is stored in the largest biometric database in the world.
